# Coingate test project “Junior QA” specialist


Project description

To test if specific parts of sandbox.Coingate.com work as expected. In this project the main goal was to make sure the web app is as much bug free as it can be.

Project content

For this project I made 3 test plans:
1. Sign-up form. https://sandbox.coingate.com/register
2. New payment button form. https://dashboard-sandbox.coingate.com/account/buttons/new
3. Happy path for invoice page.

Test Plans

Every Test Plan have test scenarios, where you can find what kind of field or scenario was tested.
Every scenario had their own test cases with more detailed steps on how exactly it was tested. 
Every single test case had their own test data, expected result, actual result, pass/fail and comments section. All the test cases have Test case #, i.e. Sign-up form has SU code and a number of case (SU1…SU5…SU15).

Bug report

During Sign up form testing phase one bug was found in SU15 test case. Bug’s priority is set to medium, because it might affect company’s image for new clients and we can’t afford these mistakes.

Improvements

Some improvement needs were found in SU4 test case. Check testing comments section for more information.

Summary

All in all Project went according to the plan and no crucial bugs were found in those parts.
Some minor bug fixes and improvements are necessary though.
